# LandingPage
  This was a project i've spend a quite amount of time developing. This is a project from a challenge in the Hiring Coders training. The purpose was to buid a Landing 
  Page from a website wich is near to the Black Friday event. I am reeeally weak at HTML and CSS, because I am a backend developer, but I'm trying to open my mind to 
  something new and, well. That was the final result. 
  I Know it is far from a good site, its not ever responive hahaha! But, as i said, im still learning and i thinks thats already a good advance for someone who,
  a few weeks ago doenst know how to use an input!
  
  Thank you for your access, and i hope you enjoy my little first project! :D
